# KSPInputLock

Locks out all ship controls at the press of a button.  
Requires blizzy78's [Toolbar](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60863) but does *not* bundle it.

## What does this do?

It gives you a Toolbar button that locks out **all** ship controls.

## Why would I want this?

If you play KSP on Windows this is probably of little use to you.  
KSP on Linux has a long-standing bug where typing anything into a text
input field (like MechJeb for example) the keystrokes get sent to the
game anyways. This accidentally triggers ActionGroups when typing numbers,
turns your ship, changes tour throttle and so on.

This mod gives you a way to type in numbers, names and other things without
fear of ruining you mission.
